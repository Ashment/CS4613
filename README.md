# PROJECT 1
# 8-Puzzle
Project 1 is an implementation of A* search algorithm. It is used to solve an "8-puzzle", where there are 8 tiles in a 3x3 grid. Given an initial state, the tiles slide around (to the empty slot in the 3x3 grid) to form an arbitrary goal state. Example input and output files are also included.
